# Applied-Machine-Learning-in-Python
This course introduced the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. The course will started with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduced the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. The issue of dimensionality of data was discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, was tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models were described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course ended with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. The outcome of this course was to be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis. 

This repo contains the resulting assignments and programming exercises.
